# klingt.net's WSL enviroment

This repository contains the configuration of my WSL enviroment.
Since I am mainly a Linux user this can be seen as the tiny version of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/klingtnet/dotfiles).

## Docker

There are a bunch of issues with using docker inside WSL, e.g. you can not mount paths from the WSL environment which is a show stopper. But, with [WSL2][wsl2] this will be solved. Hence, I will wait until Windows 10 2004 gets released before configuring docker in WSL.
